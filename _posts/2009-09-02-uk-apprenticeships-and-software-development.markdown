[Corey Haines](http://twitter.com/coreyhaines) recently blogged about [building a software development school](http://programmingtour.blogspot.com/2009/09/software-development-school-idea.html) and it got me thinking about UK [Apprenticeships](http://www.apprenticeships.org.uk/Employers/Whats-it-all-about/What-is-an-Apprenticeship.aspx) and how we could improve the "craft" here in the UK.

UK Apprenticeships (a rebranding of "Modern Apprenticeships" - also known as "Day Release") is essentially a scheme that combines on and off the job training. They cover a large array of careers but all have the same common principle: apprentices spend most of their time (typically 4-days per week) working in a real business under a mentor, and the remaining time at college studying for a recognised qualification.

According to the [Apprenticeships website](http://www.apprenticeships.org.uk/Employers/Whats-it-all-about/What-is-an-Apprenticeship.aspx)) an Apprenticeship is not a qualification itself but a framework  containing separately certificated elements.

The Apprenticeship frameworks cover a wide range of [industries](http://www.apprenticeships.org.uk/Types-of-Apprenticeships.aspx) including an [ICT Professional apprenticeship](http://www.apprenticeships.org.uk/Types-of-Apprenticeships/Information-and-Communication-Technology/ICT-Professional.aspx) - I wonder what it would take to develop a scheme for software developers which would enable UK development workshops to start taking an active role in developing the next generation of software craftsmen?
