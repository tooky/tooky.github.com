The [software craftsmanship list](http://groups.google.com/group/software_craftsmanship/browse_thread/thread/417bec17184ccfc2#) had a little flurry of activity today. [Jason Gorman](http://twitter.com/jasongorman) posted about [David Harvey's](http://www.teamsandtechnology.com/dh/blog/) [session](http://qconlondon.com/london-2010/presentation/Danger:+Software+Craftsmen+at+Work) at next years [QCon London](http://qconlondon.com/london-2010/). The talk - [Danger: Software Craftsmen at Work](http://qconlondon.com/london-2010/presentation/Danger:+Software+Craftsmen+at+Work) - unsurprisingly caused some discussion on the list!

Linked in the thread is an [interesting article](http://www.teamsandtechnology.com/dh/blog/2009/05/25/software-craftsmanship-can-we-just-get-over-it/) by David that gives a little bit more context to his position.

I have [recently joined](http://tooky.github.com/craftsmanship/eden/2009/11/25/software-craftsmanship.html) the formal apprenticeship scheme at [Eden Development](http://www.edendevelopment.co.uk), and I wanted to give some perspective of what being an apprentice means to me.

Using terms like "apprentice", "journeymen" and "master" **is** probably a bit absurd. But its absurd in a good way. [Metaphor](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?SystemMetaphor) is one of the core practices of XP, developing a system metaphor gives a team a shared vision for project. Its not meant to define what the software does, but the language of the metaphor gives the team a way to discuss the system.

The software craftsmanship metaphor gives us shared vision for improving the state of software development. Its not supposed to be new ideas, its just a new way of framing new ideas to give people a common language to use. Calling myself an apprentice allows me to say that I have a lot to learn, that I want to be part of company that is willing to invest in me, if I'm willing to invest in myself.

If I sound absurd when I tell people that, then so be it. It certainly starts the conversation.
