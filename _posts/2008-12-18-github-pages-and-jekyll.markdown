[GitHub's](http://github.com) new GitHub pages service makes it incredibly easy to host a static site, which is completely version controlled, when you add [Tom Preston-Werner's](http://mojombo.github.com) [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) into the mix you get a fantastically simple blogging platform.

To set up your github pages site all you need to do is create a [username].github.com repository and push your site to the repository. Really simple. Checkout [you.github.com](http://you.github.com) for more detailed instructions!

The great thing about this is that [GitHub](http://github.com) run your repository through [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/tree/master). This means that you can create a really simple blogging platform with all your posts stored and version controlled in git! See [Blogging Like a Hacker](http://mojombo.github.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html) for more details.

Tom has also published his [repository](http://github.com/mojombo/tpw/tree/master) to help you get started as well.

Many thanks to Tom for all of this, I've managed to put together a nice simple clean site based on his ideas, which I'm really pleased with!
