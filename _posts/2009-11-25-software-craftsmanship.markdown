I'm not sure when I first came across [software
craftsmanship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Craftsmanship), but I know
that [Dave Hoover](http://twitter.com/edentodd)'s early blogs about
[apprenticeship patterns](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596518387) were some of
the posts that made it really start to resonate with me!

In 2005 I read one of Dave's posts - [A Thread of
Patterns](http://redsquirrel.com/cgi-bin/dave/2005/04/12#a.thread.of.patterns) -
and I started to recognise some of these patterns in my own experience. This
post prompted me to email Dave and tell him a little of my story.

Reading back over those emails today its striking that I had started to look for
a mentor. That I felt that there were serious problems with the way the company
I worked for approached software, but I didn't feel I had the experience to fix
those problems, and that I needed to move and take the next step in my career.

This was 2005 - it was two more years before I left that company, and the move I
made then didn't work out the way I hoped. I learnt alot along the way, but have
never really found the culture I was looking for.

Fast-forward to today - after 5 months at [Eden
Development](http://edendevelopment.co.uk/) I feel that I have finally found a
company with a culture that I share. The company itself has been on a bit of a
[voyage of
discovery](http://blog.edendevelopment.co.uk/2009/10/13/software-craftsmanship-a-meeting-of-minds/)
and growth and I am really excited to be part of its future. Not only did we
leave our old office for the first time today, but the company started its new
formal apprenticeship scheme.

I'm pleased to say that I was offered, and have accepted, an Eden Development
apprenticeship under the guidance of [Todd
Anderson](http://twitter.com/edentodd). I'm excited to see how this program
develops, and look forward to sharing my experiences.
